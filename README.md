# Amino.py
A library for amino bots

### API Referance
SoonTM

#### What is this?
Amino.py is a python api for communicating with amino servers while pretending that you are an app user. This is mostly accomplished by spoofing device configuration headers, though actually generating those is still in progress. It is also for objectifying and organizing amino response data, so that actually doing anything is easier.

#### Why is this?
I wanted to create my very own amino api and with the help of Zero it made all of this possible <3

#### Who is this?
This version is currently being developed by [me](https://github.com/Slimakoi) cloned from Zero's [AminoAcids](https://github.com/gastrodon/AminoAcids/) repo, though pull requests and issues are very much so welcome. You can contact me on Discord at Slimakoi#6245 if you have any questions about the project, or for anything else.

## Usage
You'll need Python 3 to use it, I recommend using Python 3.6 or earlier to use the library.
To install it just open the command line and type out this command `python3 -m pip install amino.py`
